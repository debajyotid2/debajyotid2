Welcome to my profile! 

I most recently worked as a machine learning engineer at [Siemens](https://www.siemens.com/us/en/industries/battery-manufacturing.html), where I worked on developing machine learning and simulation-based solutions to build digital twins for battery manufacturing. 

I love working on interdisciplinary projects, especially using C, C++, Python or Rust. 

I occasionally contribute to open-source projects, for instance, [Home Energy Analysis Tool](https://github.com/codeforboston/home-energy-analysis-tool), but I also work on-and-off on personal projects (mostly recreational), like [One billion row challenge](https://github.com/debajyotid2/one-billion-row-challenge) and [Cryptopals](https://github.com/debajyotid2/cryptopals).

You can also check out my [blog](https://www.debdebnath.com/blog) where I write occasionally about whatever I find interesting at the moment and think might be of some use (hopefully) to anyone reading.
